Intro
-----

Ya@st (or yasst when you get sick of hitting the shift key) is a cross platform twitter
client. It's still quite basic I'm afraid, and it may
break, crash, or possibly call you rude names, your mileage may vary.

Please play with it, and check back every so often for new versions.

If you have any comments or suggestions please drop me a line at: mrrooster@yasst.org or 
@mrrooster on twitter.

Some other info
---------------

Releases are named yast-platform-cpu-YYYYMMDD.archiveformat

Windows releases will be .rar for now, linux tbz and osx may be dmg or tbz

I date the releases when I build them, so a higher numbered release is the newest for your
platform, but a higher number release for a different platform will probably not have
any more features (unless it's wildly newer.)

I'm developing this on Windows, it's likely linux and OSX releases will be less well
supported. Linux releases are built on Debian 5, 32 bit. OS X on 10.5.6.
